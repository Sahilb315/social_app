### Built with

- Flutter
- Cloud Firestore
- Provider(State Management)

### What I learned
I learned how to handle large amount of data from cloud firestore like the users personal information, their Posts & Replies, etc.
It was challenging to work with Provider and handle the states but after using it for some time, finally understood it.
